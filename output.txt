Call `v2.url` with the same publicId. `sign_url` should be `true`, `type` should be authenticated and `transformation` should be the same array as step 2.\r\n\r\n4. Fetch the url\r\n\r\nIf you get the derived assets for the public id, you can see 2 different derived assets with 2 different transformations\r\nEager
